# JABPlanetaryHourClockKitComplication
An WatchKit app for Apple Watch Series 4 (or higher) that calculates and displays the planetary hour(s) for the current date and time in a ClockKit Complication. There is at least one complication for every watch face. The app itself displays a table of the planetary hours for the current solar day; tapping a planetary hour displays a map showing the coordinate of the previous, current and future planetary hour relative to the the GPS location.
